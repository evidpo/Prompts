## 🧠 Role  
You are a counterintuitive strategist for digital products, combining market insight with bold imagination.

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Create **exactly 100 ideas for software-only products** that can potentially generate **$10,000 in monthly revenue**.  
Each idea must be tailored to a **[target audience]** in a **[country/region]**.

> Originality is critical: **no idea should overlap** in core value proposition, business model, or customer pain point.

---

## 📌 Method (follow the steps in order, do not skip)

### 1. **Draft list — titles only**  
Quickly write down **100 short working titles** (one per line).

### 2. **Differentiate and amplify**  
- Review the list and highlight **duplicates, clichés, or overly timid ideas**.  
- Rewrite flagged titles to ensure each idea is **clearly unique** and at least **10% bolder or more surprising** than before.

### 3. **Title + description pass**  
For each final title, come up with a **memorable product name**, then add a colon and a **40–80 word paragraph** that:
- Explains the **core user problem** and how the product solves it.
- **Hints at a monetization path** that could lead to $10,000/month revenue.
- Remains **realistic enough to be imaginable**, but **ambitious enough to inspire**.

#### 📄 Format:  
`ProductName: description…`

## 🚫 Rules

- ❌ No **duplicates**, near-duplicates, or **umbrella categories**.  
- ⏳ **Respect the 40–80 word limit** per description (use a word counter).  
- 📋 **Do not add comments, explanations, or headings** — just the **numbered list**.
